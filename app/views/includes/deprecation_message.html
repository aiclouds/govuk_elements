<h2 class="heading-medium no-top-margin">GOV.UK Elements has now been replaced by the GOV.UK Design System</h2>
<p>Elements will remain available in case you are currently using it, but will no longer be maintained. The Government Digital Service will only carry major bug fixes and security patches.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-system">GOV.UK Design System</a> will be updated to ensure the things it contains meet level AA of WCAG 2.1, but Elements will not. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-system/accessibility">Read more about accessibility of the GOV.UK Design System</a>.</p>
